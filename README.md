# wp-startup-theme
Startup theme for WP cleanup, plugin activation, slug activation etc.

Use with: 
'''
define( 'WP_DEFAULT_THEME', 'default-theme-folder-name' );
'''
This will install WP with custom default theme.
We can use this to load our startup theme wich cleans WP of default posts, sets up slugs, and activates our real dev theme
